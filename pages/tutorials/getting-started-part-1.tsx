          In this tutorial we learn how to setup Sketchup from the beginning to
          work best for modeling furniture and cabinets. I introduce the
          rectangle, push/pull, orbit, pan, and zoom tools.

          <strong>Note</strong> These tutorials are made with Sketchup 7. There
          have been a couple of releases since these were made and even a
          version that runs completely in your browser.
